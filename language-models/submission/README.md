# Instructions

To run the program, simply download the files or clone the repository and open in an IDE such as PyCharm (which is what I used), and click 'Run'.

The answers to the questions will output to the console, and they are formatted in a way that is easy to read.

## Libraries/Packages/venv

There were no third-party libraries used for this assignment. The program uses nothing but the standard Python library in Python v<strong>3.12</strong>.

## Additional Notes

A goal of mine while doing this project was to stick as closely as possible (within reason given Python's syntax) to Jurafsky & Martin's 3rd Edition draft of The Speech and Language Processing textbook. Some of the notation may vary slightly, but overall it conforms to the mathematical notation used in the (draft) book.
