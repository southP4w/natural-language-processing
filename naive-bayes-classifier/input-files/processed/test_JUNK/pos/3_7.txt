how many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this ? i can ' t count them but it sure seemed like the movie makers were trying to give me a hint . i was reminded so often of other movies , it became a big distraction . one of the borrowed memorable lines came from a movie from 2003 - day after tomorrow . one line by itself , is not so bad but this movie borrows so much from so many movies it becomes a bad risk . < br / > < br / > but . . . < br / > < br / > see the movie ! despite its downfalls there is enough to make it interesting and maybe make it appear clever . while borrowing so much from other movies it never goes overboard . in fact , you ' ll probably find yourself battening down the hatches and riding the storm out . why ? . . . costner and kutcher played their characters very well . i have never been a fan of kutcher ' s and i nearly gave up on him in the guardian , but he surfaced in good fashion . costner carries the movie swimmingly with the best of costner ' s ability . i don ' t think mrs . robinson had anything to do with his success . < br / > < br / > the supporting cast all around played their parts well . i had no problem with any of them in the end . but some of these characters were used too much . < br / > < br / > from here on out i can only nit - pick so i will save you the wear and tear . enjoy the movie , the parts that work , work well enough to keep your head above water . just don ' t expect a smooth ride . < br / > < br / > 7 of 10 but almost a 6 .
