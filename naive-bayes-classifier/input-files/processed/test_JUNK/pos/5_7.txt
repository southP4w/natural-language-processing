i only went to see this movie because i have always liked kevin costner . i felt that ashton did a great job in the butterfly effect . unfortunately , even though these two actors were / are capable of good if not great acting moments some of that was missing here . some of the scenes were just not believable and didn ' t have enough story line support . < br / > < br / > though the movie claims influence from the hurricane katrina aftermath , there was very little ( none ) to that effect in the movie . < br / > < br / > overall , i liked the fact that the movie brought forward some of what goes into saving lives from a water perspective . < br / > < br / > the special effects were pretty good and more than a little intimidating . not sure i ' ll ever go deep sea fishing again . . . < br / > < br / > i expected a little more emotion in the film than what was presented . < br / > < br / > definitely a movie that could ' ve been seen on dvd .
