our family ( and the entire sold out sneak preview audience ) enjoyed " the guardian " . kevin costner and ashton kutcher gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters ben and jake . after seeing this movie , you can ' t help but imagine how difficult it must be to graduate from the uscg helicopter rescue swimmer school and one day take part in real rescues . < br / > < br / > even though this is a fictional movie , it delivered rather convincing virtues of team spirit , dedication and bravery exhibited by all the members of the actual u . s . coast guard . < br / > < br / > the special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible . you actually felt like you were taking part in a real rescue . < br / > < br / > i feel the movie could have been made without the " hollywood " bar scene ( when you see the movie , you might agree ) since the real coast guard does not condone such behavior . < br / > < br / > very entertaining , very action packed , definitely worth seeing . thank you , u . s . coast guard and the real helicopter rescue swimmers , " so others may live " . i ' d highly recommend this movie to everyone .
