i was fortunate enough to see this movie on pre - release last night and , though i wasn ' t expecting to , actually really enjoyed the movie for the most part . the rescues and sea effects were amazing to watch and definitely provided edge of the seat tense moments , probably all the more so knowing that there are guys who do this for a living . the weaker parts of the movie revolve largely around using stereotypical set scenes . i ' m not going to spoil the movie but this really follows along the lines of an officer and a gentleman and those moments give it a little bit of a cheesy aftertaste . < br / > < br / > like i said over all this movie is pretty good and worth checking out as long as you can get past the clich√©s .
