my yardstick for measuring a movie ' s watch - ability is if i get squirmy . if i start shifting positions and noticing my butt is sore , the film is too long . this movie did not even come close to being boring . predictable in some parts sure , but never boring . < br / > < br / > all of the other military branches have had love notes written about them and seen their recruitment levels go up , why not the coast guard too ? they are definitely under - appreciated , until the day your boat sinks that is . < br / > < br / > the movie was very enjoyable and fun . kevin costner is perfect as the aging macho man who doesn ' t know when to quit . however , i was most impressed by ashton kutcher ' s performance . i have never liked him , never watched any of his tv shows and always considered him an immature . . . well , punk . in this film , he does a great job ! he is well on his way to having leading - man status . i think the film we were shown must have been an advance rough cut or something , because about 2 / 3 of the way in , the film stock turned very grainy , the sound level dropped and microphones were seen dropping down all over the place . also at the viewing were representatives from the movie , looking for audience feedback - particularly on the parts of the film we didn ' t like . < br / > < br / > * * * * * possible spoiler : the feedback i gave concerned a a couple of lines in the beginning . kevin costner comes home to see his wife , sela ward , packing her stuff up and moving out . he says , " maybe i should be the one to move out . " and she replies , " no , you don ' t know where anything is in this house ; i should be the one to go . " this doesn ' t make sense : if she knows the layout so well , costner is right , he * should * be the one to leave .
