my boyfriend and i went to watch the guardian . at first i didn ' t want to watch it , but i loved the movie - it was definitely the best movie i have seen in sometime . they portrayed the uscg very well , it really showed me what they do and i think they should really be appreciated more . not only did it teach but it was a really good movie . the movie shows what the really do and how hard the job is . i think being a uscg would be challenging and very scary . it was a great movie all around . i would suggest this movie for anyone to see . the ending broke my heart but i know why he did it . the storyline was great i give it 2 thumbs up . i cried it was very emotional , i would give it a 20 if i could !
