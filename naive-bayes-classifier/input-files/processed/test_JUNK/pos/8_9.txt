i ' m a petty officer 1st class ( e - 6 ) and have been in the uscg for 6 years and feel that this movie strongly represents the coast guard . there were only a few scenes that were far fetched . the most far - fetched was when po fischer ( kutcher ) went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the vessel ' s captain out of the engine room . . . that would never happen . swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances . second , the command center ( supposedly in kodiak ) , it looked more like a nasa command center . . . we don ' t have any gear that hi - tech . third , the captain of the airstation would not be running the search & rescue cases with like 10 people on watch . in reality it would be an e - 6 or e - 7 as the sar controller and maybe 2 other support personnel like an assist sar controller & a radio watchstander . otherwise the movie was dead on , i think they should have incorporated more of the other rates in the cg and their roles in search & rescue instead of just aviation based rates . some of the scenes from " a " school reminded me of my days their and the dumb stuff i did and got in trouble for in my younger days .
