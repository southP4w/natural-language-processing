this movie was sadly under - promoted but proved to be truly exceptional . entering the theatre i knew nothing about the film except that a friend wanted to see it . < br / > < br / > i was caught off guard with the high quality of the film . i couldn ' t image ashton kutcher in a serious role , but his performance truly exemplified his character . this movie is exceptional and deserves our monetary support , unlike so many other movies . it does not come lightly for me to recommend any movie , but in this case i highly recommend that everyone see it . < br / > < br / > this films is truly exceptional !
