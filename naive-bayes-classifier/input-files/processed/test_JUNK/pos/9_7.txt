i ' ve seen this story before but my kids haven ' t . boy with troubled past joins military , faces his past , falls in love and becomes a man . the mentor this time is played perfectly by kevin costner ; an ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction , to save lives . after losing his team he takes a teaching position training the next generation of heroes . the young troubled recruit is played by kutcher . while his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and don ' t generate enough heat to melt butter , he compliments costner well . i never really understood sela ward as the neglected wife and felt she should of wanted costner to quit out of concern for his safety as opposed to her selfish needs . but her presence on screen is a pleasure . the two unaccredited stars of this movie are the coast guard and the sea . both powerful forces which should not be taken for granted in real life or this movie . the movie has some slow spots and could have used the wasted 15 minutes to strengthen the character relationships . but it still works . the rescue scenes are intense and well filmed and edited to provide maximum impact . this movie earns the audience applause . and the applause of my two sons .
