i went and saw this movie last night after being coaxed to by a few friends of mine . i ' ll admit that i was reluctant to see it because from what i knew of ashton kutcher he was only able to do comedy . i was wrong . kutcher played the character of jake fischer very well , and kevin costner played ben randall with such professionalism . the sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions . this one did exactly that . the entire theater ( which was sold out ) was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie , and were moved to tears during the second half . while exiting the theater i not only saw many women in tears , but many full grown men as well , trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying . this movie was great , and i suggest that you go see it before you judge .
