i wish i knew what to make of a movie like this . it seems to be divided into two parts - - action sequences and personal dramas ashore . it follows ashton kutsher through survival swimmer school , guided by master chief kevin costner , then to alaska where a couple of spectacular rescues take place , the last resulting in death . < br / > < br / > i must say that the scenes on the beach struck me as so stereotypical in so many ways that they should be barnacle encrusted . a typical bar room fight between navy guys and coast guardsmen ( " puddle pirates " ) . the experienced old timer costner who is , as an elderly bar tender tells him , " married to the coast guard . " the older chief who " keeps trying to prove to himself that he ' s still nineteen . " the neglected ex wife ashore to whom kostner pays a farewell visit . the seemingly sadistic demands placed on the swimmers by the instructors , all in pursuit of a loftier goal . the gifted young man hobbled by a troubled past . < br / > < br / > the problem is that we ' ve seen it all before . if it ' s kevin costner here , it ' s clint eastwood or john wayne or lou gosset jr . or vigo mortenson or robert deniro elsewhere . and the climactic scene has elements drawn shamelessly from " the perfect storm " and " dead calm . " none of it is fresh and none of the old stereotyped characters and situations are handled with any originality . < br / > < br / > it works best as a kind of documentary of what goes on in the swimmer ' s school and what could happen afterward and even that ' s a little weak because we don ' t get much in the way of instruction . it ' s mostly personal conflict , romance , and tension about washing out . < br / > < br / > it ' s a shame because the u . s . coast guard is rather a noble outfit , its official mission being " the safety of lives and property at sea . " in war time it is transferred to the navy department and serves in combat roles . in world war ii , the coast guard even managed to have a medal of honor winner in its ranks . < br / > < br / > but , again , we don ' t learn much about that . we don ' t really learn much about anything . the film devolves into a succession of visual displays and not too much else . a disappointment .
