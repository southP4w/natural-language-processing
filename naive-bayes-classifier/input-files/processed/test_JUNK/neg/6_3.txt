a tough sell : british playwright ronald harwood adapts his autobiographical stage drama into loud , bellowing film about wwii shakespearean theatrical troupe saddled with an aged , blustery , brilliant - but - unreliable star at the end of his tether . the actor ' s effete assistant works diligently to get his master coiffed and costumed for a production of " king lear " ( during an air raid ! ) , yet both men are losing their grip on their unraveling situation . based on the waning years of actor donald wolfit , whose dresser was ronald harwood , this acclaimed production would seem to be a welcome haven for scenery - chewing thespians . unfortunately , albert finney ( at this point in his career , not at all elderly ) seems too robust and quick - thinking to play the actor ; finney ( and oscar - nominated director peter yates ) cannot modulate sir ' s moods and bouts of coherency in a way that makes sense to us , so that in one scene he ' s stopping a train with the commanding echo of his voice , and in the next he ' s curiously falling apart . with such a wreck of a human being in the midst of failing health and aptitude , one would assume a dedicated assistant would go to great lengths to protect his boss ( and his future ) , yet servant tom courtenay prods and badgers and goads finney to carry on rather than rest . courtenay , who played this part on stage ( and was nominated for an oscar alongside finney for best actor ) , is far more attuned to his role , and eventually his bleating commands and confusion achieve the only real feeling in the film . these two , thankfully , do not peck at each other ' s heads , and scenarist harwood is careful not to fall into a love - hate pattern ( which could possibly be perceived in the film ' s first act ) ; but , without a juxtaposition of servant vs . celebrity , there ' s nothing much to behold in this portrait except for the deterioration of narcissism , the hint at what once was . * 1 / 2 from * * * *
