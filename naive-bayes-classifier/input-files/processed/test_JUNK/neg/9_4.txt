david bryce ' s comments nearby are exceptionally well written and informative as almost say everything i feel about darling lili . this massive musical is so peculiar and over blown , over produced and must have caused ruptures at paramount in 1970 . it cost 22 million dollars ! that is simply irresponsible . darling lili must have been greenlit from a board meeting that said " hey we got that pink panther guy and that sound of music gal . . . lets get this too " and handed over a blank cheque . the result is a hybrid of gigi , zeppelin , half a sixpence , some mgm 40s song and dance numbers of a style ( daisies and boaters ! ) so hopelessly old fashioned as to be like musical porridge , and mata hari dramatics . the production is colossal , lush , breathtaking to view , but the rest : the ridiculous romance , julie looking befuddled , hudson already dead , the mistimed comedy , and the astoundingly boring songs deaden this spectacular film into being irritating . lili is like a twee 1940s mega musical with some vulgar bits to spice it up . star ! released the year before sadly crashed and now is being finally appreciated for the excellent film is genuinely is . . . and andrews looks sublime , mature , especially in the last half hour . . . . . . but lili is poppins and dolly frilly and i believe really killed off the mega musical binge of the 60s . . . . . and made andrews look like poppins again . . . which i believe was not edwards intention . paramount must have collectively fainted when they saw this : and with another $ 20 million festering in catch 22 , and $ 12 million in on a clear day and $ 25 million in paint your wagon . . . . they had a financial abyss of cleopatra proportions with $ 77 million tied into 4 films with very uncertain futures . maybe they should have asked seer daisy gamble from on a clear day . . . . . . lili was very popular on immediate first release in australia and ran in 70mm cinemas for months but it failed once out in the subs and the sticks and only ever surfaced after that on one night stands with on a clear day as a sunday night double . thank god paramount had their simple $ 1million ( yes , one million dollar ) film love story and that $ 4 million dollar gangster pic the godfather also ready to recover all the $ 77 million in just the next two years . . . . for just $ 5m . . . . incredible !
