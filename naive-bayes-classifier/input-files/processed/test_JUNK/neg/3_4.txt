wow , another kevin costner hero movie . postman , tin cup , waterworld , bodyguard , wyatt earp , robin hood , even that baseball movie . seems like he makes movies specifically to be the center of attention . the characters are almost always the same . . . the heroics , the flaws , the greatness , the fall , the redemption . yup , within the 1st 5 minutes of the movie , we ' re all supposed to be in awe of his character , and it builds up more and more from there . < br / > < br / > and this time the story . . . story ? . . . is just a collage of different movies . you don ' t need a spoiler ; you ' ve seen this movie several times , though it had different titles . you ' ll know what will happen way before it happens . this is like mixing an officer and a gentleman with backdraft , but both are easily better movies . watch backdraft to see how this kind of movie should be made . . . and also to see how an good but slightly underrated actor , russell , plays the hero .
