i ' m not a big fan of musicals , although this technically might not qualify as a musical . but i thought i would give it a chance as i love war movies . it was mediocre at best . < br / > < br / > hudson seems totally out of kilter in this role . it just didn ' t work for me . julie andrews probably played her part as best as she could , but i just find it hard to buy her as a conniving , deceptive spy . sorry , i know that is classic stereotyping on my part . but i have to say i think this is julie at her most beautiful and feminine looking . i always thought of her as more matronly , but then surely that ' s a result of her roles in sound of music and mary poppins . no doubt they were desperately trying to get her out of that typecasting in this role . she was quite beguiling in appearance here , but i still didn ' t buy her as a spy . < br / > < br / > i couldn ' t keep my focus through the whole movie and found myself tuning in and out - and having conversations with those in my room ( which i usually never do - i ' m always shushing everybody ) . so that tells you how little it held my attention . don ' t waste your time !
