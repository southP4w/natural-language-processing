it seems ever since 1982 , about every two or three years we get a movie that claims to be " the next officer and a gentleman . " there has yet to be one movie that has lived up to this claim and this movie is no different . < br / > < br / > we get the usual ripped off scenes from oaag ( " i want you dor , " the instructor gives the richard gere character his overdose of drills in hopes he ' ll quit , the gere character comes back for the girl , the gere character realizes the instructor is great , etc . ) and this movie is as predictable as the sun rising in the east and is horribly miscast on top . costner plays his usual " wise teacher " character , the only character he can play , and you really get a sense of his limited acting abilities here . kutcher is terrible in the richard gere character , just miscast with acting skills barely a notch above keanu reeves . < br / > < br / > the main problem with this oaag wannabe is the two main characters are so amazingly one - dimensional , you never care for either in the least and when kutcher ' s character finally turns around ( just like gere did in oaag ) you just go " so what ? the movie leaves no plot point unturned and seems to never end as if to say " oh wait , we forgot to close out the girlfriend story , or the what happens after he graduates story , or the other six plot points in the movie . . . " what ' s more baffling is the great " reviews " i see here . the general public ' s opinions never cease to amaze me .
