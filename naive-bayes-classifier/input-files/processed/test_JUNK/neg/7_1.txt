blake edwards ' legendary fiasco , begins to seem pointless after just 10 minutes . a combination of the eagle has landed , star ! , oh ! what a lovely war ! , and edwards ' pink panther films , darling lili never engages the viewer ; the aerial sequences , the musical numbers , the romance , the comedy , and the espionage are all ho hum . at what point is the viewer supposed to give a damn ? this disaster wavers in tone , never decides what it wants to be , and apparently thinks it ' s a spoof , but it ' s pathetically and grindingly square . old fashioned in the worst sense , audiences understandably stayed away in droves . it ' s awful . james garner would have been a vast improvement over hudson who is just cardboard , and he doesn ' t connect with andrews and vice versa . and both andrews and hudson don ' t seem to have been let in on the joke and perform with a miscalculated earnestness . blake edwards ' sob isn ' t much more than ok , but it ' s the only good that ever came out of darling lili . the expensive and professional look of much of darling lili , only make what it ' s all lavished on even more difficult to bear . to quote paramount chief robert evans , " 24 million dollars worth of film and no picture " .
