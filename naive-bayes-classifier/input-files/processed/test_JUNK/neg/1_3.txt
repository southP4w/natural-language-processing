this is a pale imitation of ' officer and a gentleman . ' there is no chemistry between kutcher and the unknown woman who plays his love interest . the dialog is wooden , the situations hackneyed . it ' s too long and the climax is anti - climactic ( ! ) . i love the uscg , its men and women are fearless and tough . the action scenes are awesome , but this movie doesn ' t do much for recruiting , i fear . the script is formulaic , but confusing . kutcher ' s character is trying to redeem himself for an accident that wasn ' t his fault ? costner ' s is raging against the dying of the light , but why ? his ' conflict ' with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle . i saw this sneak preview for free and certainly felt i got my money ' s worth .
