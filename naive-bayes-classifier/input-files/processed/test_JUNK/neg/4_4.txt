alas , another costner movie that was an hour too long . credible performances , but the script had no where to go and was in no hurry to get there . first we are offered an unrelated string of events few of which further the story . will the script center on randall and his wife ? randall and fischer ? how about fischer and thomas ? in the end , no real front story ever develops and the characters themselves are artificially propped up by monologues from third parties . the singer explains randall , randall explains fischer , on and on . finally , long after you don ' t care anymore , you will learn something about the script meetings . three endings were no doubt proffered and no one could make a decision . the end result ? all three were used , one , after another , after another . if you can hang in past the 100th yawn , you ' ll be able to pick them out . despite the transparent attempt to gain points with a dedication to the coast guard , this one should have washed out the very first day .
