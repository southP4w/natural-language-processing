this is one of the dumbest films , i ' ve ever seen . it rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them all . < br / > < br / > there ' s not a single good line or character in the whole mess . if there was a plot , it was an afterthought and as far as acting goes , there ' s nothing good to say so ill say nothing . i honestly cant understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and actually released , does somebody somewhere not at some stage think , ' oh my god this really is a load of shite ' and call it a day . its crap like this that has people downloading illegally , the trailer looks like a completely different film , at least if you have download it , you haven ' t wasted your time or money don ' t waste your time , this is painful .
