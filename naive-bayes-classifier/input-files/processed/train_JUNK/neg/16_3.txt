there are lots of extremely good - looking people in this movie . that ' s probably the best thing about it . perhaps that even makes it worth watching . < br / > < br / > " loaded " tells the story of tristan price ( jesse metcalfe ) , a young man who ' s about to make his mark on the world . he ' s the son of a well - to - do family with a good reputation , and he ' s on his way to law school . but like so many such settings , things aren ' t quite as perfect as they appear . the expectations in this family far outweigh the love . except for school , tristan ' s father rarely lets him leave the house . this seems to be the result of some past traumatic event that shook the family , which is partially revealed through flashbacks but isn ' t spelled out until the very end . tristan ' s claustrophobic environment causes him to let loose in very extreme ways at the first possible opportunity , when his friends take him out to a strip club to celebrate his graduation . the celebration soon follows some strippers back to a beach house party , and from there , tristan befriends sebastian cole ( corey large ) , who pulls him into a drug dealing underworld . < br / > < br / > while technically well - made , this movie suffers from a lackluster script and a storyline that isn ' t very engaging . also counting against this film are some constant camera tricks that generally seemed annoying and out - of - place , such as slow - motion , fast - motion , freeze - frames and echos . these are the types of effects a director might normally utilize to show a character ' s perspective while on drugs , except in this case they seem to have been sporadically tossed in at random points , in some cheap attempt at style . < br / > < br / > despite its cast of relative unknowns , performances were good all around , most notably with respect to the main antagonist ( corey large ) . i suspect we ' ll be seeing at least a couple of these people in bigger and better projects in the future . < br / > < br / > of course , when mentioning the actors , i must mention their looks . rating based on hotness , this movies scores an 11 . the women in this movie are incredible - looking and almost distract you from what a boring movie you ' re watching . i ' m sure the male characters are also quite attractive , but you ' ll have to ask someone else to comment on that . < br / > < br / > overall , i can ' t recommend this movie , not for buying , renting , or even seeing for free . it ' s unfortunately just not worth the effort it takes to sit through .
