this film had a lot of promise , and the plot was relatively interesting , however the actors , director and editors seriously let this film down . < br / > < br / > i feel bad for the writers , it could have been good . the acting is wooden , very few of the characters are believable . < br / > < br / > who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film . there are lots of quick ' flashy ' edits in almost every scene , which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying . < br / > < br / > i wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no , it left me feeling like i ' d wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money .
