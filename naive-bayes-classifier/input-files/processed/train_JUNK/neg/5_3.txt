i basically skimmed through the movie but just enough to catch watch the plot was about . to tell you the truth it was kind of boring to me and at some spots it didn ' t make sense . the only reason i watched this movie in the first place was to see chace crawford ! ! ! he is so hot , but in this movie his hair was kind of weird . but still hot . < br / > < br / > however , despite how hot chace is , it really did not make up for the film . i guess the plot isn ' t that bad but what really threw me over was the fact that they cuss in like every sentence . is it that hard to express your anger without saying the f word every time ? the cussing was annoying and the whole flashy , camera shaking thing gave me a headache . < br / > < br / > all in all , although the plot was ok , i found the film to be a bore and over dramatic . that ' s why i only cut to scenes with chace in it . lol anyways , not worth renting unless your a die - hard fan of a specific cast member like i was . oh yeah the cast was hot . the girls were hot ! ! ! but chace is the best ! !
