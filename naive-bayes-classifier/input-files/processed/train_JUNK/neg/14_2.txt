there are times when finishing a film one wishes to have a refund for the time just spent . this was one of those times . i almost gave up with only 15 minutes left to endure . . . and i wish i had . . . < br / > < br / > the pace that a man goes from a straight - laced , controlled life to one of complete spinelessness and irresponsibility could never be this rapid . < br / > < br / > from a graduation celebration to the predictable ending tristan price ( jesse metcalfe ) man of privilege and culture allows himself to be seduced by a woman , by violence , and by mind altering substances . of course , the woman part is understandable when observing the talents of the beautiful april ( nathalie kelley ) . but the in for a penny in for a pound aspect of the drugs , violence and dedication to a person he has just met is impossible to understand . < br / > < br / > frankly , besides being able to stare at nathalie kelley and monica keena , this film has no redeeming qualities . save your money , save your time . . . do anything else . . .
