if i had not read pat barker ' s ' union street ' before seeing this film , i would have liked it . unfortuntately this is not the case . it is actually my kind of film , it is well made , and in no way do i want to say otherwise , but as an adaptation , it fails from every angle . < br / > < br / > the harrowing novel about the reality of living in a northern england working - class area grabbed hold of my heartstrings and refused to let go for weeks after i had finished . i was put through tears , repulsion , shock , anger , sympathy and misery when reading about the women of union street . excellent . a novel that at times i felt i could not read any more of , but i novel i simply couldn ' t put down . depressing yes , but utterly gripping . < br / > < br / > the film . oh dear . hollywood took barker ' s truth and reality , and showered a layer of sweet icing sugar over the top of it . a beautiful film , an inspiring soundtrack , excellent performances , a tale of hope and romance . . . yes . an adaptation of ' union street ' . . . no . < br / > < br / > the women of union street and their stories are condensed into fonda ' s character , their stories are touched on , but many are discarded . i accept that some of barker ' s tales are sensitive issues and are too horrific for mass viewing , and that a film with around 7 leading protagonists just isn ' t practical , but the content is not my main issue . the essence and the real gut of the novel is lost - darkness and rain , broken windows covered with cardboard , and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced with sunshine , pretty houses , and a twinkling william ' s score . < br / > < br / > if you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of ' reality ' , i advise that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like ' schindler ' s list ' . . . but without the happy ending .
