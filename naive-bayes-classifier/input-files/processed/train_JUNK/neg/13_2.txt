weak plot , predictable violence , only semi interesting characters . like the writer ( also one of the stars ? ) was fictionalizing his own screw ups and added an incredulous fantasies of drugs and murder to make it " hot " . from the predictable rap and house soundtrack , to the family conflicts , it ' s poorly acted , stereotypical , and ultimately terribly boring . even the title has been done before - imdb lists five movies with the same name released in 2007 - 2008 ! ! < br / > < br / > note : saw it on showtime , which listed the synopsis for one of the other movies . was halfway thru before i realized no one was an undercover cop . even tho another stereotype , would have made it interesting if it happened .
