robert deniro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time . this movie is so wasteful of talent , it is truly disgusting . the script is unbelievable . the dialog is unbelievable . jane fonda ' s character is a caricature of herself , and not a funny one . the movie moves at a snail ' s pace , is photographed in an ill - advised manner , and is insufferably preachy . it also plugs in every cliche in the book . swoozie kurtz is excellent in a supporting role , but so what ? < br / > < br / > equally annoying is this new imdb rule of requiring ten lines for every review . when a movie is this worthless , it doesn ' t require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape . avoid this movie .
