this is it . this is the one . this is the worst movie ever made . ever . it beats everything . i have never seen worse . retire the trophy and give it to these people . . . . . there ' s just no comparison . < br / > < br / > even three days after watching this ( for some reason i still don ' t know why ) i cannot believe how insanely horrific this movie is / was . its so bad . so far from anything that could be considered a movie , a story or anything that should have ever been created and brought into our existence . < br / > < br / > this made me question whether or not humans are truly put on this earth to do good . it made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe . this type of movie sincerely hurts us as a society . we should be ashamed . i really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art , is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good . it ' s an embarrassment . i don ' t know how on earth any of these actors , writers , or the director of this film sleeps at night knowing that they had a role in making " loaded " . i don ' t know what type of disgusting monsters enjoy watching these types of movies . < br / > < br / > that being said , i love a good " bad " movie . i love shark attack 3 , i love bad taste , they are hilarious . i tell all my friends to see them because they are " bad " . < br / > < br / > but this . . . . . . . this crosses the line of " bad " into a whole new dimension . this is awkward bad . this is the bad where you know everything that is going to happen , every line , every action , every death , every sequence before they happen ; and not just like a second or two before , i mean like , after watching the first 5 minutes before . < br / > < br / > every cheesy editing " effect " is shamelessly used over and over again to a sickening point . i really never want to see the " shaky " camera " drug buzz rush " effect or jump cuts or swerve cuts or any fancy cut ever again ever . this is meticulously boring , repetitive and just tortures the audience . < br / > < br / > but . . . . . . . and let me be specific here , the most disturbing thing about this movie is that given the production , it appears that a somewhat decent amount of money was actually put into this excrement . i personally will grab the shoulders of the director if i ever see him and shake him into submission , demanding that he run home and swallow two - gallons of drain - o or i will do it for him . < br / > < br / > if we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for our war prisoners abroad , just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell over and over again . trust me , i think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the 72nd time of sitting through this . < br / > < br / > stop these movies , they are just the most vile of all facets of our society . please . stop . now .
