if you look at corey large ' s information here on imdb , apparently there ' s a movie called " reload " in production ( as of june ' 08 ) in which he ' s playing a character named sebastian cole . < br / > < br / > first of all , how does such a crappy movie ever earn a sequel . . . and second , didn ' t sebastian get killed at the end of " loaded " ? < br / > < br / > i watched this in the wee hours of the morning when i was battling insomnia , and so i was drifting in and out while it was on . i ' m sure i missed some plot points , but overall , it seemed really weak . large ' s performance was ( for me ) one of the stronger parts of the film . i ' m also a bit surprised at all the people commenting on the beautiful girls , since i thought the actress playing brooke was pretty , but not exceptional .
