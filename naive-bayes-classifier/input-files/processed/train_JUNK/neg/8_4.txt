6 / 10 acting , not great but some good acting . < br / > < br / > 4 / 10 director , makes some stupid decisions for this film . < br / > < br / > 2 / 10 writer , story makes no sense at all and has huge amount of flaws . < br / > < br / > 4 / 10 overall score for this movie . < br / > < br / > don ' t waste your time with this film , it ' s not worth it . i gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much . characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens " storywise " , not in good way . because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes ( too many special effects : slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards ) . it ' s always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but there ' s too many tracks in this one . in the first hour there is almost 50 / 50 dialogs and musics
