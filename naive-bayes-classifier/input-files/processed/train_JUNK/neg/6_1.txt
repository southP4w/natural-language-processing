from the beginning of the movie , it gives the feeling the director is trying to portray something , what i mean to say that instead of the story dictating the style in which the movie should be made , he has gone in the opposite way , he had a type of move that he wanted to make , and wrote a story to suite it . and he has failed in it very badly . i guess he was trying to make a stylish movie . any way i think this movie is a total waste of time and effort . in the credit of the director , he knows the media that he is working with , what i am trying to say is i have seen worst movies than this . here at least the director knows to maintain the continuity in the movie . and the actors also have given a decent performance .
