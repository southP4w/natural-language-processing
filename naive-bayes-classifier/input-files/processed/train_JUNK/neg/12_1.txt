all i could think of while watching this movie was b - grade slop . many have spoken about it ' s redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events . yet really , the techniques used ( as many have already mentioned ) were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole . < br / > < br / > as far as the plot is concerned , it was lacklustre , unimaginative , implausible and convoluted . you can read most other reports on this film and they will say pretty much the same as i would . < br / > < br / > granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action . . . looks can only carry a film so far . the action is poor and intermittent : a few punches thrown here and there , and a final gunfight towards the end . nothing really to write home about . < br / > < br / > as others have said , ' bad ' movies are great to watch for the very reason that they are ' bad ' , you revel in that fact . this film , however , is a void . it ' s nothing . < br / > < br / > furthermore , if one is really in need of an educational movie to scare people away from drug use then i would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that board such issues in a much more effective way . ' requiem for a dream ' , ' trainspotting ' , ' fear and loathing in las vegas ' and ' candy ' are just a few examples . though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like ' go ' ( overall , both serious and funny ) and ' halfbaked ' . < br / > < br / > on a final note , the one possibly redeeming line in this movie , delivered by vinnie jones was stolen from ' lock , stock and two smokling barrels ' . to think that a bit of that great movie has been tainted by ' loaded ' is vile . < br / > < br / > overall , i strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by not seeing this movie .
