fair drama / love story movie that focuses on the lives of blue collar people finding new life thru new love . the acting here is good but the film fails in cinematography , screenplay , directing and editing . the story / script is only average at best . this film will be enjoyed by fonda and de niro fans and by people who love middle age love stories where in the coartship is on a more wiser and cautious level . it would also be interesting for people who are interested on the subject matter regarding illiteracy . . . . . . .
