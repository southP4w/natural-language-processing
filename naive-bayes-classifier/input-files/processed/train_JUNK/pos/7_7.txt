although i didn ' t like stanley & iris tremendously as a film , i did admire the acting . jane fonda and robert de niro are great in this movie . i haven ' t always been a fan of fonda ' s work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time . de niro has the ability to make every role he portrays into acting gold . he gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for elderly people because he can ' t care for him anymore that will break your heart . i wouldn ' t really recommend this film as a great cinematic entertainment , but i will say you won ' t see much bette acting anywhere .
