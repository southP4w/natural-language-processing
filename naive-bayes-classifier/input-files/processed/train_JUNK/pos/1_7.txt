if you like adult comedy cartoons , like south park , then this is nearly a similar format about the small adventures of three teenage girls at bromwell high . keisha , natella and latrina have given exploding sweets and behaved like bitches , i think keisha is a good leader . there are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school . there ' s the idiotic principal , mr . bip , the nervous maths teacher and many others . the cast is also fantastic , lenny henry ' s gina yashere , eastenders chrissie watts , tracy - ann oberman , smack the pony ' s doon mackichan , dead ringers ' mark perry and blunder ' s nina conti . i didn ' t know this came from canada , but it is very good . very good !
