working - class romantic drama from director martin ritt is as unbelievable as they come , yet there are moments of pleasure due mostly to the charisma of stars jane fonda and robert de niro ( both terrific ) . she ' s a widow who can ' t move on , he ' s illiterate and a closet - inventor - - you can probably guess the rest . adaptation of pat barker ' s novel " union street " ( a better title ! ) is so laid - back it verges on bland , and the film ' s editing is a mess , but it ' s still pleasant ; a rosy - hued blue - collar fantasy . there are no overtures to serious issues ( even the illiteracy angle is just a plot - tool for the ensuing love story ) and no real fireworks , though the characters are intentionally a bit colorless and the leads are toned down to an interesting degree . the finale is pure fluff - - and cynics will find it difficult to swallow - - though these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture wouldn ' t really be satisfying any other way . * * * from * * * *
