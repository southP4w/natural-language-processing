bromwell high is nothing short of brilliant . expertly scripted and perfectly delivered , this searing parody of a students and teachers at a south london public school leaves you literally rolling with laughter . it ' s vulgar , provocative , witty and sharp . the characters are a superbly caricatured cross section of british society ( or to be more accurate , of any society ) . following the escapades of keisha , latrina and natella , our three " protagonists " for want of a better term , the show doesn ' t shy away from parodying every imaginable subject . political correctness flies out the window in every episode . if you enjoy shows that aren ' t afraid to poke fun of every taboo subject imaginable , then bromwell high will not disappoint !
