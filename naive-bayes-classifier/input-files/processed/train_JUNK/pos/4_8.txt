futz is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in new york in the 1960s ( the origins of off off broadway ) . though it ' s not for everyone , it is a genuinely brilliant , darkly funny , even more often deeply disturbing tale about love , sex , personal liberty , and revenge , a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when congress wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our constitution . the story is not about being gay , though - - it ' s about love and sex that don ' t conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate . on the surface , it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig , but like any great fable , it ' s not really about animals , it ' s about something bigger - - stifling conformity in america . < br / > < br / > the stage version won international acclaim in its original production , it toured the u . s . and europe , and with others of its kind , influenced almost all theatre that came after it . luckily , we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived , with the original cast and original director , tom o ' horgan ( who also directed hair and jesus christ superstar on broadway ) . < br / > < br / > this is not a mainstream , easy - to - take , studio film - - this is an aggressive , unsettling , glorious , deeply emotional , wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that you ' ll never forget . and it just might change the way you see the world . . .
