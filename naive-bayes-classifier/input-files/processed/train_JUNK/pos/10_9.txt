i ' m a male , not given to women ' s movies , but this is really a well done special story . i have no personal love for jane fonda as a person but she does one hell of a fine job , while deniro is his usual superb self . everything is so well done : acting , directing , visuals , settings , photography , casting . if you can enjoy a story of real people and real love - this is a winner .
