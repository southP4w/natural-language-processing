i guess if a film has magic , i don ' t need it to be fluid or seamless . it can skip background information , go too fast in some places , too slow in others , etc . magic in this film : the scene in the library . there are many minor flaws in stanley & iris , yet they don ' t detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible , the hardest to fix . both characters are smart . yet stanley can ' t understand enough to function because he can ' t read ; he can ' t read because he ' s had too much adventure in his childhood . iris , although well - educated , hasn ' t had enough adventure and so can ' t understand how to move past the u - turn her life took . in both their faults and strengths , the characters compliment each other . it may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an iris would wind up working year after year in a factory , or that a stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better - paying job . and while these " mysteries " are explained in the course of the story , their unfolding seems somewhat contrived . i assume no one took the time to rethink the script . even so , it ' s a good movieÂ—just imagine what de niro , fonda and plimpton would have done on screen if someone had !
