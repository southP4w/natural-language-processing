" all the world ' s a stage and its people actors in it " - - or something like that . who the hell said that theatre stopped at the orchestra pit - - or even at the theatre door ? why is not the audience participants in the theatrical experience , including the story itself ? < br / > < br / > this film was a grand experiment that said : " hey ! the story is you and it needs more than your attention , it needs your active participation " . " sometimes we bring the story to you , sometimes you have to go to the story . " < br / > < br / > alas no one listened , but that does not mean it should not have been said .
