i found this to be a so - so romance / drama that has a nice ending and a generally nice feel to it . it ' s not a hallmark hall of fame - type family film with sleeping - before - marriage considered " normal " behavior but considering it stars jane fonda and robert de niro , i would have expected a lot rougher movie , at least language - wise . < br / > < br / > the most memorable part of the film is the portrayal of how difficult it must be to learn how to read and write when you are already an adult . that ' s the big theme of the movie and it involves some touching scenes but , to be honest , the film isn ' t that memorable . < br / > < br / > it ' s still a fairly mild , nice tale that i would be happy to recommend .
