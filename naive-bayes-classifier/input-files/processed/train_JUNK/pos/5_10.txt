i came in in the middle of this film so i had no idea about any credits or even its title till i looked it up here , where i see that it has received a mixed reception by your commentators . i ' m on the positive side regarding this film but one thing really caught my attention as i watched : the beautiful and sensitive score written in a coplandesque americana style . my surprise was great when i discovered the score to have been written by none other than john williams himself . true he has written sensitive and poignant scores such as schindler ' s list but one usually associates his name with such bombasticities as star wars . but in my opinion what williams has written for this movie surpasses anything i ' ve ever heard of his for tenderness , sensitivity and beauty , fully in keeping with the tender and lovely plot of the movie . and another recent score of his , for catch me if you can , shows still more wit and sophistication . as to stanley and iris , i like education movies like how green was my valley and konrack , that one with john voigt and his young african american charges in south carolina , and danny devito ' s renaissance man , etc . they tell a necessary story of intellectual and spiritual awakening , a story which can ' t be told often enough . this one is an excellent addition to that genre .
