this film has a special place in my heart , as when i caught it the first time , i was teaching adult literacy . it rang very true to me and even an outstanding student i had at the time . there are scenes which make you gulp with sudden emotion , and those which even put a smile on your face through sheer identification with the characters and their situation . < br / > < br / > excellent performances by jane fonda and robert deniro that rank with their best work , a great turn by a young martha plimpton , an inspiring story line , and a haunting musical score makes for a most enjoyable and rewarding experience .
